#  Weather based Road Accident Prediction for Driversâ€™ Safety

This repository contains the code and analysis for my project onRoad Accident Prediction, focused on exploring the relationship between weather, road features, time-of-day, and accident severity.


- Code was developed and run on **Google Colab**.
- Colab notebook is in the f`.ipynb` format

## Dataset

- Dataset used: [US Accidents (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents)
- A sampled version is used which includes 500,000 dataset which is in CSV format.  It can be downloaded directly from Google Drive the link is also given in the kaggle website and can also download from this link (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U3u8QYzLjnEaSurtZfSAS_oh9AT2Mn8X/edit).

## How to Run

1. **Open Google Colab**:  
   Visit (https://colab.research.google.com/) and upload the provided notebook.
   
2. **Dataset Access**:  
   - Download the CSV from the link above and upload to Colab,
    **or**
    
   - Can mount your Google Drive in Colab using:
     
     ```python
     from google.colab import drive
     drive.mount('/content/drive')
     ```
     Then set the file path accordingly.
     
3. **Run the Code**:  
   Execute each cell in order for data cleaning, EDA, and visualization.



- Please ensure you have all required Python libraries installed if you are using your own device (e.g., pandas, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn).
- All visualizations and code are optimized for Colab environment.
- For any issues with the dataset link, refer to the Kaggle dataset page(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents ).
